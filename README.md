# Simple Node Boilerplate - ZSTIX
A barebones setup used to quickly get ideas up and running.

## Setup
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Update the `package.json` file to reflect the name of your project.
  3. Delete the original remote. Create a repository if needed.

## Working with Files / Local Development
  1. Run `gulp` in the directory.
  2. Thats it!
    - Gulp will convert, concat, and minify all SCSS and JS.
    - The server will restart with any changes to back-end JS.
    - Front-end JS will be linted and any errors are reported in the console.

## TODO
  - Document how to push up to heroku.
  - Create an example route / api.
  - Create an example / documentation for DB calls (if needed).
  - Add in a testing platform.
  - Create a _very_ basic stylesheet for prototypes.
